1. created the columns with row and column class
row display flex
column display inline flex box and flex 50% -> 2 cloumns

2. playerArea display block will display the cardBox and scoreBox as blocks so they wont collapse with each other
. Try removing block to see what i mean

var img = new Image()
img.width = 100//how can we chanage the units, is there a different way??
